## ÀyáloOnline
Àyálo Online is a platform which provides borrowed project equipment. You don't need to own any equipment to execute a project, whether it's a big road construction concern or as small as a Media project.
All you need is the "Àyálo Online" platform, from concept to market the platform will give you the space to execute as though you had a full efficient space, studio, workshop etc.
The platform does not own any equipment but will congregate individuals and companies that own the equipment and help you start and finish the project in time and budget.
